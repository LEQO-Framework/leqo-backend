Setup
=====

The LEQO-Backend is provided as a docker-image and can be run:

- **Standalone**: for backend-only use
- **In combination with frontend**: for full-stack development

Youâ€™ll need:

- Docker + Docker Compose installed
- Basic terminal access

To get started install `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_ and follow the instructions below.

Standalone
----------

Use this for just hosting the backend without frontend (or separate from it).
Run the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

    cp .env.template .env
    docker compose -f compose-dev.yaml up --build

.. tip::
   The commands above use the default configuration that can be changed as described in :doc:`Configuration <config>`

With Frontend
-------------

You can host both the frontend and backend together with docker compose.

**Step 1:** Create a project directory
    .. code-block:: shell

        mkdir leqo
        cd leqo

**Step 2:** Create a `compose.yml` file with the following contents:
  .. literalinclude:: downloads/compose.yaml
     :language: yaml
     :linenos:

  Download this file: :download:`compose.yml <downloads/compose.yaml>`

  If you don't need configuration, you can use this file: :download:`compose.simple.yml <downloads/compose.simple.yaml>` and skip Step 3.

**Step 3:** Create the `.env` file according to the instructions in :doc:`Configuration <config>`.

**Step 4:** Pull container images
    .. code-block:: shell

        docker compose pull

**Step 5:** Start the application
    .. code-block:: shell

        docker compose up -d

**Step 6:** Open the frontend
    Navigate to: `localhost:80 <http://localhost:80>`_

**Step 7:** Configure the backend port in the frontend

    - Go to **Configuration**
    - Set the **Low-Code Backend Endpoint** to: `http://localhost:8000`
